intro about career - 
as i have mentioned in the self assessment mail...that i graduated in 2017..and whne	 i wasa hired by yatra...they hired me as a web developer backend services in java. so the time i was recruited by the company i had not done much work on any technology or even java itself.
i was only good at problem solving algos and datastructure but never had a deep knowledge about the web thechnology.


low rating and no front end / machine learning

why not applying for other companies

Things that i m proud of - probe , scripts rfs qa, superPnr failures in seperate dbs.

what are your expectations from us.


One more reason for leaving is that -
I have seen the work culture of my company. i would say that it is not that good. bcoz here most of the thing that i worked on were just told to me verbely. there was no requirement documentation or any record of the change that happened which is not a good practice.
infact one more thing...when i came to yatra...i was given the codebase of the flights projects....and i was told to understand the project just by reqding the codebase. which is impossible. i mean without the business logic...how can you understand such a big project.  there is no document which explaing the reuirement or the logic behind the wotrking of the project.
Every time i had to go to my techlead or some collegue to understang how are thing working.
So now the question in my mind is that how other companies work.


Explain me a bug that you have worked on?

Do you have any questions?

A lot.
