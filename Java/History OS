OS - a software thst acts as an intermidiate person between the hardware and the software.
Goels of OS - A user can directly access the OS using machine language, but OS helps to make it efficient and userFriendly.
Functions - Memory, I/O devices, File, Network, Security Management etc is done by OS.

1) CPU have only a small memory
	- No secondary Memory
	- One program is loaded processed and output is produced.
	- ideal CPU
	
2) Batch Processing 
	- No secondary Memory
	- BatchManager is introduced whose task is to collect similar processes and club them in a batch and them provide it to CPU so that 
	  the processing improves.
	- too much waiting time from input output devices (ideal CPU)

3) SPOOLING - simultaneous peripheral operation online
	- secondary memory is introduced
	- I/O devices loads the data into the secondary memory  
	- Main memory / CPU interacts with the secondary memory for processing (less ideal in this case)
	- Sequential Processing .. hence if the current running process need to wait .. CPU becomes ideal	

4) MultiProgramming (context switiching is introduced)
	- if the current running process is interupted then the CPU switches the context to another process and starts processing.
	
5) MultiTasking 
	- in multiProgramming context is switched only when the current process gows to a waiting state on its own.
	  But in case of Multitasking the CPU itself switches the context based on some algorithm(Round Robin may be) so quickly that 
          it apperars to perform multiple task at the same time.

6) MultiProcessing 
	- Up till now there was only one processor that could handle only one process at a time (yes context switching is there), but 
          it was still slow.
	- MultiProccessing introduced multiple cores(processors)..that used the same element of the computer(Secondary Memory, Buses, Registers)
          except the processor part.
	- Hence MultiThreding was introduced.
	- Multiple processes running simultaneously on different cores. 
	
7) Distributed Systems (Load balancing)
	- Multiple computers for handling heavy load using some load balancer.
